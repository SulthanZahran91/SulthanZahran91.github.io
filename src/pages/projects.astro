<!-- ### TO DO
Project Showcase 
• RTD Test Suite
Technology: C# (WPF)
◦ Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to simulate real-time data (RTD) scenarios
from production within the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) test environment.
• SQL Version Control and Analyzer
Technology: Python (PyQt)
◦ Developed a centralized GUI that consolidates RTD GDC developer changes and automates SQL analysis.
• RTD Development
Technology: SQL
◦ Optimized empty tray movement to and from preaging process in RTD (Real-Time Dispatch), an
automated decision-making system in LG Ensol’s battery factory logistics.
• MES Development
Technology: C# (WPF) + SQL
◦ Focused on testing and development of formation building for MES (Manufacturing Execution System)
that bridges planning systems and production operations.
◦ Worked with interactive GUI that enables factory operators to manage production processes effectively.
• Spectroscopy Real-time Data Analyzer
Technology: MATLAB
◦ Developed a MATLAB GUI using App Designer for spectroscopic data analysis with features for
real-time measurement visualization.
• Temperature Data Acquisition System
Technology: Arduino + Python (Tkinter) + Schematic Design
◦ Developed an integrated system for temperature data acquisition, including a custom GUI interface,
electronic schematics, and Arduino-based hardware implementation.
• Scanning Probe Microscopy Prototype
Technology: Arduino + Python (Tkinter) + Schematic Design
◦ Developed a comprehensive prototype for scanning probe microscopy system, including a graphical user
interface, electronic schematics, and Arduino-based control with noise filtering architecture.
• Cream Spreader Wafer Machine Control
Technology: PLC + HMI (Schneider)
◦ Designed and implemented a PLC ladder logic program and human-machine interface (HMI) system to
control the cream spreading mechanism for a wafer production machine.
• IndySCC22 Supercomputing Competition 2022
Technology: Bash Script + Python (Numpy, Pandas, Paramiko)
◦ Commissioned clusters through bash scripting, configured Slurm workload manager, installed
computational physics software across multiple nodes, and managed parallel computation execution.
